## **Relational Tables/Lists: NONE REQUIRED** ✅

This Assets list is **completely standalone** with **NO lookup dependencies**.

### Why No Relationships?

1. **AssignedTo** uses built-in Person/Group field (links to Azure AD automatically)
2. **Unit** and **Division** use simple Choice fields (no separate lists needed)
3. **Vendor** stored as text (no vendor master list needed)
4. All other fields are self-contained

### Alternative Approach (Optional - NOT Required)

If you want more advanced features in the future, you COULD create separate lookup lists:

**Optional Future Lists** (NOT needed for Phase 1):
- `Vendors` (if you want to manage vendor information centrally)
- `AssetTypes` (if you want to manage asset categories dynamically)
- `Divisions` (if you want centralized division management)

**But for now**: Keep it simple with a single standalone Assets list.
